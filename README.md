# Inverse-Kinematics-Demo
just a ball moving with perlin noise and 50 Tentacles following it (based on Inverse Kinematics).

## Description

This really should have been a better demo, it just looks like tentacles wanting a circle. But if you know Inverse kinematics, this is somewhat like that.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FINN-2005/Inverse-Kinematics-Demo.git
```
2) Install pygame.
